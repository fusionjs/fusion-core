# What is FusionJS

FusionJS is a web application framework developed by Uber. Because Uber operates on a large scale in countries with slow mobile networks, performance is a big driving factor for FusionJS.

It has a modular architecture in order to promote small bundle sizes, and it is designed in such a way that performance milestones in FusionJS' development pipeline can be rolled out to consumers of the framework via version bumps, as opposed to requiring big migrations or entirely offloading that work to app developers.

Here are the features you'll find in FusionJS:

- server side rendering and async rendering
- ES2017 and JSX support out of the box
- hot module reloading in development mode
- bundle splitting
- universal rendering (run the same code in the server and the browser)
- server-side development via Koa.js
- plugin-based architecture (so you only include what you need in your browser bundles)
- a curated set of plugins for data fetching, styling, etc maintained by the FusionJS team
- plugins for error logging, security, etc
- bundle analysis tooling
